## Description
1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars. <br>

<br>

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once). <br>

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words. <br>

<br>
<br>

Example 1: <br>

~~~
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
~~~

Example2: <br>
~~~
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
~~~

<br>

Note: <br>

1. 1 <= words.length <= 1000
2. 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
3. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
const countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    return words.reduce((lengths, word) => {
        const forms = chars.split("");
        if (word.split("").every(w => {
            const index = forms.indexOf(w);
            if (index > -1) {
                forms.splice(index, 1);
                return true;
            }
        })) {
            lengths += word.length;
        }
        return lengths;
    }, 0);
};
```
