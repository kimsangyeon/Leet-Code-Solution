662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

<br>

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree. <br>

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. <br>

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation. <br>

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer. <br>

Example 1: <br>

~~~
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
~~~

<br>

Example 2: <br>

~~~
Input: root = [1,3,null,5,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
~~~

<br>

Example 3: <br>

~~~
Input: root = [1,3,2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
~~~

<br>

Example 4: <br>

~~~
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,null,7]
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
~~~
