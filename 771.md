## Description
771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. <br>

<br>

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". <br>

<br>

Example 1: <br>

~~~
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
~~~

Example 2: <br>

~~~
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
~~~

<br>

Note: <br>

- S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- he characters in J are distinct.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} J
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
    const stones = S.split('');
    return J.split('').reduce((cnt, j) => {
        stones.find(s => {
           if (s === j) {
               cnt++;
           } 
        });
        return cnt;
    }, 0);
};
```
