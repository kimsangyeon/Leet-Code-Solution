## Description
1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation

<br>

You are given an even integer n​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation perm of size n​​ where perm[i] == i​ (0-indexed)​​​​. <br>

<br>

In one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i: <br>

- If i % 2 == 0, then arr[i] = perm[i / 2].
- If i % 2 == 1, then arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2].

You will then assign arr​​​​ to perm. <br>

<br>

Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value. <br>

<br>

Example 1: <br>

~~~
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: perm = [0,1] initially.
After the 1st operation, perm = [0,1]
So it takes only 1 operation.
~~~

<br>

Example 2: <br>

~~~
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.
After the 1st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
After the 2nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
So it takes only 2 operations.
~~~

<br>

Example 3: <br>

~~~
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
~~~

<br>

Constraints: <br>

- 2 <= n <= 1000
- n​​​​​​ is even.
